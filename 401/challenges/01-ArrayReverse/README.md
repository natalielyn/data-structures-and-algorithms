# Reverse an Array
Take an array and return the reversed array.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach we took was to declare a function that takes in an array as a argument. The function also declares a new array and a counter variable that is set to 0. The array then loopes through a for loop function in a decrementing direction. Within the for loop, the new array will have its index numbers assigned by the original array being looped while incrementing the counter variable. Thhis returns us with a reversed array.
