# Array Shift
Insert and shift an array in middle at index

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
Declare a function that accepts an array and a value. Within that function declare a new empty array. Then assign the value to the middle index of the new array through a for loop, if the index doesn't equal the middle index, insert that value into the array.
